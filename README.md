This is a very simple implementation of a Sierpinski Triangle done in SFML. I made this as a fun little side project as the Sierpinski has to be one of the funnest and easiest fractals to produce. My implementation is very simple and just uses an """std::vector""" to hold all the points. The calculated coordinates are stored in a """sf::Vector2f""" , drawing these points is then done by iterating through the """std::vector""" and drawing a unit circle at the current position. Calculating the points is done recursively, a depth and the current existing vector is also passed by reference. I must admit this isn't the most optimized code and many optimizations can be made (for instance no need for return in """calculateNewPosition()""" , but I wrote it to better understand SFML and the C++ language.
